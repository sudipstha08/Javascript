 *  You can easily see the stack trace in JavaScript by adding the following into your code:

 * These anonymous functions pose a threat to our debugging. If our stack traces include anonymous functions, we’ll greatly reduce the value of the stack trace because it’s much harder to see the steps that lead to an error. This will make our whole debugging process
