## class
- Template for an object

## object
- instance of the class
In object-oriented programming, an instance is a concrete realization of a class. When you define a class, you're essentially creating a blueprint. An instance, then, is an object built from that blueprint. It has all the characteristics defined in the class, but with specific values.

## Main principles of OOP
- encapsulation
- abstraction
- inheritance
- polymorphism

### Encapsulation

### Abstraction
- only showing essential details and keeping everything else hidden

### Inheritance
- allows classes to derive from other classes

### Polymorphism
- describes methods that are able to take on many forms
- two types
  - dynamic
    - occurs during runtime
  - static 
    - occurs during compile time
    - refers to whem multiple methods with the same name but different arguments are defined in the same class
