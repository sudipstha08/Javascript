## Spread

- Spread Operator (...):
The spread operator allows an iterable (such as an array or string) to be expanded into individual elements. It is used to "spread" elements in places where multiple arguments or elements are expected.
It can be used in function calls, array literals, object literals, and more.
In function calls, the spread operator can be used to pass an array as arguments to a function.
In array literals, the spread operator can be used to concatenate arrays or create a shallow copy of an array.
In object literals, the spread operator can be used to merge objects or clone objects.


- The rest parameter allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
It collects all remaining arguments into a single array parameter.
It is used in function definitions to capture multiple arguments passed to a function.
The rest parameter must be the last parameter in the function's parameter list.
