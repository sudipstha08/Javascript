## Queue

- A queue is a linear data structure in which elements are inserted from one end called the rear and deleted from the other end called the front. 
- It follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the element inserted first will be the one to be removed first.
- Queues are commonly used in various computing scenarios such as job scheduling, task processing, breadth-first search algorithms, and more.

### Key operations in a queue include:

 - `Enqueue`: Insert an element at the rear of the queue.
 - `Dequeue`: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
 - `Peek/Front`: Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
 - `isEmpty`: Check if the queue is empty.
 - `size`: Get the number of elements in the queue.
