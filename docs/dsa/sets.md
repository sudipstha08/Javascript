## Sets

- A set is a collection of distinct elements where each element appears only once. 
- Sets are commonly used to store unique values and perform operations such as union, intersection, difference, and membership tests efficiently.
- ES6 has an built in set object 
- Key characteristics of sets include:
- Uniqueness: Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If an element is added to a set that already contains it, the set remains unchanged.
- No Specific Order: The elements in a set are not stored in any particular order. The order of elements is implementation-dependent and may vary.
- Efficient Operations: Sets typically provide efficient operations for adding, removing, and testing for the presence of elements. These operations often have time complexities that are better than linear time.
  
- Sets can be implemented using various data structures, such as hash tables, balanced trees (e.g., red-black trees), or bit arrays (for small sets of integers).
  
- In many programming languages and libraries, sets are provided as built-in data structures with methods for common set operations. These methods often include:
  - add(element): Add an element to the set if it's not already present.
  - delete(element): Remove an element from the set if it exists.
  - has(element): Check if an element exists in the set.
  - size(): Get the number of elements in the s  et.
  - clear(): Remove all elements from the set. 
  - Set operations like union, intersection, difference, subset, etc., depending on the language or library.
