## Priority Queue

- A priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular `queue` or `stack`, but with each element assigned a `priority`.
- The element with the highest priority is `dequeued` first.
- Priority queues are commonly used in various computing scenarios where elements need to be processed in order of their priority, such as job scheduling algorithms, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and Huffman coding.
- Priority queues can be implemented using various data structures, such as heaps, balanced binary search trees, or arrays.

  
### Key operatations in a priority queue include
 -`Insert`: Insert an element into the priority queue with an associated priority.
 -`DeleteMax/DeleteMin`: Remove and return the element with the highest/lowest priority from the priority queue.
 -`PeekMax/PeekMin`: Get the element with the highest/lowest priority without removing it.
 -`isEmpty`: Check if the priority queue is empty.
 -`size`: Get the number of elements in the priority queue.
