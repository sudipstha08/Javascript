## Binary Seach Tree

- A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
- It is a data structure used in computer science for organizing and storing data in a sorted manner. 
- Each node in a Binary Search Tree has at most two children, a left child and a right child, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node. 
  
- The key property of a binary search tree is that for every node:
  - All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
  - All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
- This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
