## Stacks
- `Stack` refers to a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are commonly used in various programming scenarios, such as function calls, browser history management, and expression evaluation.
  
- Functions: 
  - push(element): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
  - peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
  - isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
  - clear(): Removes all elements from the stack.
  - size()/size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.
  - print(): Prints all elements of the stack.

- Arrays can be used to implement stack because of the similar methods to stack that array provides
