## Primitive data type
 - A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods
 - A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value
 - primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
 - Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed) represented directly at the lowest level of the language.
 - All primitive types, except null and undefined, have their corresponding object wrapper types, which provide useful methods for working with the primitive values.
 - JS has 7 primitive data types
    - string
    - number
    - boolean
    - null
    - undefined
    - symbol
    - bigint
