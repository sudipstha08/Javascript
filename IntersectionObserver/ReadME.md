## Intersection Observer
- The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.
- Intersection Observer takes a Callback which gets called everytime something you observing changing its intersection 
- By default as soon as the single pixel of the element is visible, then it will be set to visible `entry.isIntersecting = true`
